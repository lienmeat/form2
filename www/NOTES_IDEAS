NOTES/IDEAS:

Role based access control

Bound to users, and then Forms.

For example, take this scenario:

Roles:[ 
  <department>editor {
    permissions [
      view,
      edit,
    ]
  },
  
  <department>staff {
    permissions [
      view,
      notify,
    ]
  },
  
  <department>admin {
    permissions [
      view,
      edit,
      admin,
    ]
  }
]

forms[ 
  <department>signup {
    roles [
      <department>editor,
      <department>admin,
      <department>staff,
    ]
  }
]


users[
  eric.lien {
    roles[
      <department>admin,
      exampleotherrole,
      <department_other>editor,
    ]
  }
]

eric.lien would have admin rights on the form <department>signup, and other roles/perms on other stuff (not shown)
