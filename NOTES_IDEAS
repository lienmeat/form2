NOTES/IDEAS:

OK

For Element(the part of a question that holds inputs) declaration/edit/config:

	Gui/ELEMENT editing, and how it all works together:
		Normal form editing at top that you can add questions to which map to config[question_name][value] for question/element variables.


		At bottom of normal form editing, you have a text area to define in HTML & JSON what the element contains as far as inputs and html.  JSON will be denoted with <json></json> tags, so we can pull it out easily and not have to parse a bunch (simple preg...).

		Also need some sort of template system to map values from questions to actual input config. (perhaps use #variablename# as it can't be something in JSON definition, as we have to replace values INSIDE json.

		Example of proposed editing of element:  

			<div id="#configfieldname#"><JSON>{type: 'text', name: 'addr1', attributes: {style: 'color: red;' onclick: 'function(){ alert(\'boom!\'); }'}, disabled: 'disabled'}</JSON></div>

		(name: properties of inputs will ALWAYS be prefixed with the question name when a question is saved durring form creation)

		so, if I add a question to a form that and I name it "parentsaddress", the above defined text element would be named "parentsaddress_addr1" in the final form.

		IDs will be similar, but I haven't decided how yet, and it will be automatic, and WILL overwrite whatever you set as an ID of an input!

		The alternative, in case you want to use JS in your element definition for some crazy reason, is using the input_id attribute, which when I'm done with the core JS lib, will have a selector set up to work as if you did one over id (although of course the syntax will be different than #id).
